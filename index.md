I am a PhD student in computational logic at the [Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.at/).
I am interested in automated reasoning and computational proof theory.
I am currently writing my doctoral thesis under the supervision of [Stefan Hetzl](https://www.dmg.tuwien.ac.at/hetzl/index.html).
In this thesis I explore the limits of various mechanisms for the automation of mathematical induction.
