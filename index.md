I am currently a software engineer at <a>ITSV</a> working on the modernization of legacy systems.
</p>
<p>
I hold a PhD degree in artificial intelligence, with a specialization in automated reasoning. My doctoral dissertation, entitled <em>The limits of automated inductive theorem provers</em>, was conducted under the supervision of <a href="https://www.dmg.tuwien.ac.at/hetzl/index.html">Stefan Hetzl</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to my professional work as a software engineer, I am actively engaged in ongoing research within the field of automated reasoning.
